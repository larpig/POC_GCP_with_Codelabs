    "AI Platform Notebooks has a direct integration with git, so that you can do version control directly within your notebook environment. This supports committing code right in the notebook UI, or via the Terminal available in JupyterLab. In this section we'll initialize a git repository in our notebook and make our first commit via the UI.\n",
